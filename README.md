SimRank Low-Parametric & Matrix

This code utilizes two functions:
1) Accelerated SimRank computation using matrix formulation with GMRES solver
2) Low-parametric solution of SimRank that allows to obtain approximation to SimRank matrix with matrix of lesser size

Project uses datasets from [SNAP: Stanford Large Network Dataset Collection](https://snap.stanford.edu/data/index.html).
